# Snake Game

I always wanted to created the snake game on my own, but I never really got my hands on programming it. This year i decided to finally code this game in my new favorite programming language C.

## How to play the game

The commands bellow will guide you in how to clone, compile and play the game 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lluuiizz/snake-game.git $HOME/snake
  cd snake/src
  sudo apt-get install gcc      // Run this command only if you dont have GCC
  gcc snake.c -o snake          // Compiling using the GCC compiler
  ./snake                       // This will run the game
```
 The game accept only four key as inputs: W, A, S, D who change the direction of the snake.
## What inspired me to do that
